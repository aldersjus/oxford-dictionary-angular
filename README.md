This project connects to the Oxford English dictionary. You can search base words eg: have(NOT having), it is a simple
Angular app to understand how to use Services for communicating between components(siblings) and how to connect to a
remote server. It has basic functionality. However, it is far from a finished app.

There is a slightly different take on this application at the below link, they are essentially the same application just wired up a little differently. As stated earlier both of these applications were built as a learning exercise and nothing more.
